Overall decent"

Burton is a very good prof for 2030, he normally teaches it every year and his teaching techniques are very good and its easy to focus in his class. You cant go wrong with him. I had Burton Ma last year for 2030, and he taught very well and explained topics in such a way that everyone understood, I think it will be worth while to switch to his section."
