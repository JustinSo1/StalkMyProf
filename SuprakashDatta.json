      "answer": "Prof Datta is Overall a solid guy. The class is tough, but if you attend most of his lectures and keep up in the textbook there's no question you wont do well in the class. Only Reason hes not 5/5 is because he never ever ever returns anything on time. Expect to have everything back a month after you write it LOL. But yea solid prof ."

Does Suprakash Datta explain EECS3214 well? How much time is spent studying for assignments and homework for EECS3214 with Suprakash Datta? ",
      "answer": "Great Professor who genuinely cares about the students and the program. Lectures are informative and follows the slides and book closely. You MUST study from the book and not (primarily) the slides. Questions are open ended (This is a good thing; too much detail for brute memorization) and assignments are fair."

      "answer": "his exam questions are far too ambiguous and open. Instead of putting questions from important parts of chapter, his questions are unknown as something too specific as a diagram or summary of entire section in a question and with so long powerpoint videos!!!! for the first time i am looking at such dense notes so it confuses as how deep to study ."

      "answer": "Prof doesn't provide feedback and takes forever to give grades back. His tests are so open ended. I thought his lectures were so boring, hes so monotone. His assignments weren't too hard. Try to listen to him in class even though you might be fighting the need to drift off into a deep sleep."

      "answer": "Very fair prof. Love his midterm and exam. A lot of questions have multiple solutions. If you can give something creative within the theory discussed in class you usually get full marks. Doesn't make you memorize anything, just wants to see you understand what's going on. Assignments are easy. Guaranteed credit with an honest effort."

      "answer": "Lectures were pretty good. Lecture slides could've been better, but if you read the slides from other sections/years along with his, you could skip using the textbook. Assignments/tests/exam were common with James Elder's section and were fair and gave plenty of bonuses."

Plus if you actually talk to him he has good stories/life advice."

      "answer": "Professor Datta is by far one of the best professors I have ever had. I had him for discrete math, which is why the difficulty level was so high. However, he takes time out of his schedule to organize study sessions before tests and he genuinely cares about his students. His lectures are extremely informative and he explains concepts very clearly."

He's still a really cool guy and will go the distance to make you understand the material. Also, don't_skip_any_of_the_tutorials. Most of the exercises he covers in tutorials show up on tests."
