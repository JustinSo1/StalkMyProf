      "answer": "Jeff's a really interesting guy with a unique style. You might find some of his ideas hard to map (fairy god mothers aren't usually an interview answer) but the steps work everywhere. Always the steps. He can get hard to follow but he tries, and he records lectures. Participation grades are weird, final is a killer (seriously), tests are fair."

      "answer": "He has his own teaching style ive never seen before. His slides are very boring and dull. He makes simple things very complicated. His tests are fair but the course itself is hard and he isnt the best at teaching, but is doable. I had to work very hard for this course. He is a nice person tho and really cares about students."

      "answer": "Great Proff! He cares about the students, will always answer questions. He has his own way of explaining concepts which you have to understand. Doesn't regrade for tests and if he does he will regrade your whole test and may lower the grade. For the tests make sure he shows you step by step how to answer the questions (ie reductions and proofs)."

      "answer": "Follow his methodology and you should do ok. Read his lecture notes and listen to him when he does his examples in class. Ask him questions. Hes a pretty funny guy. Also go to his tutorials! He does all his examples in them and goes over them so many times. His style is unusual but just put in some work and you will pass!"

      "question": "Is Jeff Edmonds a nice professor for EECS2001? ",
      "answer": "Jeff is a good teacher for theoretical cs. The only comment I will say is that he uses fairy god mothers and gnomes to explain concepts to people over 20 years old. I prefer more of a formal style of teaching but he did make the concepts easy to understand."

      "question": "Should I attend EECS3101 lectures with Jeff Edmonds? ",
      "answer": "Jeff teaches material in an abstract way such that you can apply these concepts to more general problems. You will first (and may continue to) find the way he lectures confusing but eventually (hopefully) you will find yourself understanding the material once understanding his teaching style."

      "answer": "Firstly, 2001 is a hard course. It's 100% theoretical and abstract. Just remember that when you take the course. Now, when you have course material that's super hard, it helps to have a professor who teaches well. Jeff is super patient, answers literally 2 dozen questions every class, and wants everyone to pass. He makes the course bearable."

His beautiful long hair keeps you energized, but his soft soothing voice is what keeps you coming back to class. He explains everything in great detail and will go over it until you understand it. Jeff is truly an inspiration."
