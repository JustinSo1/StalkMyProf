      "answer": "He's generally a pretty nice guy, but the way he grades students for their contributions to the course makes it feel like he's just trying to kill their motivation to actually complete it. By the way, I hope you're mentally prepared to write essays on some of the mundane stuff imaginable. Definitely wouldn't take a course with him again."

      "answer": "His marking is insane. Don't expect higher than a C on an essay (class average on the 1st essay was around a 50/100). Lectures are boring. Lots of reading, and quiz questions are based on very specific information from the readings. Multiple essays, with a combined total of around 4500 words. Nice guy though."
