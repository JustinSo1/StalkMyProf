{"kamen kanev eecs2021 prof": ["I saw how he taught. Learn on your own and pass the course. Still attend the class, it'll strongly help you be on track. It doesn't matter if he teaches horrible or not. Just attend. You don't have to pay attention to him.", "Hey I'm in this class too and regret not dropping it earlier. Kanev is down right a terrible instructor. The reason why his RMP rating is high is because he gets his poor  ratings deleted. Professors with  an RMP page can complain and the rating will be taken down. This is why some awful profs at York have high ratings  and this is why RMP ratings should always be taken with a grain salt. Unfortunately it doesn't look like there's much we can do at this point except read the book (which is awful in its own right). I finished the verilog pre-lab today but could not finish his secret lab question, which by the way is a retarded thing only he does. Last semester the pre-lab was the lab you handed in. The guy's a total ass-hat and completely unaware how awful he is at teaching .", "is amir ashouri better? i heard Minas is equally horrible"]}
