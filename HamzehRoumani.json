            "answer": "Great prof! Answers questions in class well whenever we don't understand anything. I like he also talks about how the topics taught will relate to us in the corporate world. He is good at making examples for us to have deeper understanding. Although his tests are very technical, study hard and you'll be fine."

            "answer": "He teaches really well. His lectures are amazing and very inspirational. His lab tests are fair but in theory test he will try his level best to fail you. Most of the questions has nothing to do with the topics he covered in the lecture. DO NOT take class with him unless you're really genius or you will fail or barely pass."

            "answer": "Good teacher.  He's strict, but his reasoning is sound.  Your performance in his class reflects how prepared you currently are for the workforce.   i.e you can have a great GPA, but if you've only do the required labs, you'll probably get a D.  Spend some time exploring the topic in depth (on your own) if you want to get any better than that."

The course itself is new so it was a bit disjointed between the lectures and labs which probably made the in class tests harder than they needed to be. The lab component made up for it by being really easy."
